# zigTest
Testing library for zig.

This was made simply as a learning project for building a libray with zig, to build you can run `zig build -Denable-demo` to build the demo executable as well, or simply run `zig build`.
\
The executable for the demo will be outputted to `zig-out/bin/demo.exe`, and the library will be available in `zig-out/lib/zigTest.a`.
